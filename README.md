## Philosophy

Quickly annotate screenshots with boxes, arrows and text. No options. No fuss. Paste a new image, hold 'b' for a box, hold 'a' for an arrow, tap 't' for text. Take a screenshot to export again.

## Changelog

### version 0.0.3

* You can paste images in now. Still no drawing tools ...
